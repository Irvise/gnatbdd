Controlling the output
**********************

GNATbdd provides a rich set of options for controlling the output.

Colors
======

Color output is enabled by default when the terminal supports it. It is used to
highlight passing, failing and skipped tests.

On Windows, you must install the package `ANSICON
<https://github.com/adoxa/ansicon/>`_ to get color output.

(See also https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama)
Or perhaps ansi.sys
